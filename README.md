## Implement chunk-based processing using **Google Cloud Pub/Sub**, 

#### You can follow these steps. This approach involves chunking large inputs, publishing each chunk as a message to a Pub/Sub topic, and processing each message in subscribers (e.g., Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, or GKE). Here's a step-by-step guide:

### 1. **Set Up Pub/Sub in GCP**
First, you need to set up a Pub/Sub topic and subscription in your GCP project.

1. **Create a Pub/Sub Topic**:
   - Go to the **Pub/Sub** section in the Google Cloud Console.
   - Click **Create Topic** and give it a name, like `chunked-text-processing`.

2. **Create a Subscription**:
   - After creating the topic, create a **subscription** for this topic.
   - Choose **Push** or **Pull** based on how you want your service to consume the messages.

### 2. **Chunk the Data and Publish Messages**
You need to split the large input data into smaller chunks, then publish each chunk as a message to the Pub/Sub topic.

Here’s how you can chunk and publish messages in Python:

```python
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1

# Initialize Pub/Sub publisher
project_id = "your-gcp-project-id"
topic_id = "chunked-text-processing"
publisher = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient()
topic_path = publisher.topic_path(project_id, topic_id)

def chunk_text(text, max_tokens=1000):
    # Function to chunk large text into smaller parts
    chunks = []
    words = text.split()
    chunk = []
    tokens = 0

    for word in words:
        chunk.append(word)
        tokens += len(word)  # Approximate token count
        if tokens >= max_tokens:
            chunks.append(' '.join(chunk))
            chunk = []
            tokens = 0
    if chunk:
        chunks.append(' '.join(chunk))

    return chunks

def publish_chunks(text):
    chunks = chunk_text(text, max_tokens=1000)
    for chunk in chunks:
        message_bytes = chunk.encode("utf-8")
        future = publisher.publish(topic_path, data=message_bytes)
        print(f"Published message ID: {future.result()}")

# Example usage
large_text = "Your large input text here"
publish_chunks(large_text)
```

### 3. **Set Up a Subscriber to Process Each Chunk**
Next, you'll need a subscriber that processes each message. You can use a **Cloud Function** or **Cloud Run** to listen to the Pub/Sub topic and call OpenAI's API for each chunk.

#### Example Cloud Function (Python):

```python
import openai
import os
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1

# Set up your OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

def process_openai_chunk(text_chunk):
    # Function to call OpenAI API with each chunk
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=text_chunk,
        max_tokens=100  # Adjust as needed
    )
    return response['choices'][0]['text']

def pubsub_trigger(event, context):
    # Pub/Sub trigger function
    message = event['data']
    text_chunk = message.decode("utf-8")

    # Process the chunk with OpenAI API
    result = process_openai_chunk(text_chunk)
    print(f"Processed chunk: {result}")
```

### 4. **Deploy the Subscriber to GCP**
If you're using **Cloud Functions**, you can deploy it as a subscriber to the Pub/Sub topic.

Deploy the Cloud Function using the following command:

```bash
gcloud functions deploy process-openai-chunk \
    --runtime python310 \
    --trigger-topic chunked-text-processing \
    --entry-point pubsub_trigger \
    --set-env-vars OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

### 5. **Combine the Results (Optional)**
Once all chunks are processed, you can store the results in a GCP storage bucket or database. You could also use Pub/Sub to publish the final result back to a different topic for further processing.

### 6. **Advantages of This Approach**
- **Scalability**: Pub/Sub can automatically handle a high volume of messages by scaling up the number of subscribers (e.g., Cloud Functions).
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Each chunk is processed asynchronously, allowing for parallel processing.
- **Decoupled System**: Pub/Sub decouples the large text splitting from the OpenAI processing, making your system more modular and easier to manage.

By using Google Cloud Pub/Sub and chunking your data, you can avoid hitting OpenAI’s limits while ensuring smooth processing for large queries.
